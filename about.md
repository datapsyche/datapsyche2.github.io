## About Me
Hi There, Thank you for visiting  I'm Jithin J Kumar and this is my Personal Blog. It is very very messy as of now because i'm in the process of learning Data Science i'm just once year into my journey to become a Data Scientist (as on  31st December, 2018) . I plan to spend more time and effort to make this a structured blog for data science enthusiasts who want to pursue a career as a data scientist.

## My Incredible Career Journey

- Analyst in Big Four Audit Company (Ernst And Young - GDS) for 2.5 years - Greatfull to everyone who i happened to meet in EY. Great People, Great Leaders I learned a lot from here. It was my job as analyst here that helped me gather necessary courage to pursue Data Science as my career
- Various Short term Marketing Jobs
  - CRISIL - Business Development Officer (2 Months  - I realize that i was really bad at convincing people to buy things that are less usefull)
  - ITC - Project Support Intern (15 Days Internship - I really though I could Marketing would be my forte and i was trying hard at something that i was not good at)
  - Stellar Data Recovery - I was into business development for a data recovery software business. Good exposure into the tough field marketing job. I now appreciate the efforts of field marketing executives because of my stint here) (2 months)

* Masters in Finance and Marketing from Rajagiri Business School - I got to learn quite a lot from the eminent professors here. Finance was my favourite subject and still it is. I enrolled for a dual specialisation course as it would give me more opportunities if things do not work out well, Guess i was wrong here. !
* Volunteering - Part Time Teaching in NGO (Make a Difference and Belong Foundation )
  * I was a part time teacher in an NGO named Make a Difference in kerala, Subjects i teach included Maths, Physics and English. I was working in orphanages as part time teacher
  * Belong Foundation was a spin off by a group of volunteers from MAD - We were more focused on a community instead of orphanages as orphanages are more or less self sufficient while backward communities are mostly neglected.
* Bachelors in Technology (Electronics and Communication Engineering) - Studied Electronics and communication under  the impression that i would have a great career in Electronics Boy i was wrong by second year i understood i was nowhere close to being a good electronics engineer. 
* Schooling - Cochin Refineries School, Ambalamughal - The school has been shifted to a new location and hence i feel i lost connect with here, Past has been truly beautifull and throughly greatfull to god for allowing me to have my schooling in this awesome place.
