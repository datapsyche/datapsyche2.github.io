## About Me
Hi There, Thank you for visiting  I'm **Jithin J Kumar** and this is a **Personal Study Blog**. It is very very messy as of now because i'm in the process of learning Data Science i'm just once year into my journey to become a Data Scientist (as on  31st December, 2018) . I plan to spend more time and effort to make this a structured blog for data science enthusiasts who want to pursue a career as a data scientist.

### My Incredible Career Journey..

- **Data Scientist at Grad Valley Data Science** - I finaly found my true calling, Currently I'm working as Intern Data Scientist at GradValley Data Science as a part of 6 month Industry Sponsored Fellowship Program in AI / ML.

- **Analyst in Big Four Audit Company (Ernst And Young - GDS) for 2.5 years** - Greatfull to everyone who i happened to meet in EY. Great People, Great Leaders I learned a lot from here. It was my job as analyst here that helped me gather necessary courage to pursue Data Science as my career
- Various Short term **Marketing Jobs**
  - **CRISIL - Business Development Officer** (2 Months  - I realized that i was really bad at convincing people to buy things that are less usefull)
  - **ITC - Project Support Intern (15 Days Internship)** - I really thought Marketing would be my forte and i was trying hard at something that i was not good at which is making dealers enroll in Loyality Programs. I visited shops in length and breadth of southern Kerala to enroll them into ITC loyality program
  - **Stellar Data Recovery Business Development Officer** - I was into business development for a data recovery software business. Good exposure into the tough field marketing job. (I now appreciate the efforts of field marketing executives because of my stint here) (2 months)

* **Masters in Finance and Marketing from Rajagiri Business School** - I got to learn quite a lot from the eminent professors here. Finance was my favourite subject and still it is. I enrolled for a dual specialisation course as it would give me more opportunities if things do not work out well, Guess i was wrong here. !
* **Volunteering - Part Time Teaching in NGO (Make a Difference and Belong Foundation) - (4 Years)**
  * I was a part time teacher in an NGO named Make a Difference in kerala, Subjects i teach included Maths, Physics and English. I was working in orphanages as part time teacher
  * Belong Foundation was a spin off by a group of volunteers from MAD - We were more focused on a community instead of orphanages as orphanages are more or less self sufficient while backward communities are mostly neglected.
* **Bachelors in Technology (Electronics and Communication Engineering)** - Studied Electronics and communication under  the impression that i would have a great career in Electronics Boy i was wrong by second year i understood i was nowhere close to being a good electronics engineer. 
* **Schooling - Cochin Refineries School, Ambalamughal** - The school has been shifted to a new location and hence i feel i lost connect with here, Past has been truly beautifull and throughly greatfull to god for allowing me to have my schooling in this awesome place.
